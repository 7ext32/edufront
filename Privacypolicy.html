                                legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.<br/><br/>

                                The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such
                                action is necessary to:<br/>

                                The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no
                                method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
                                secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your

                                If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and
